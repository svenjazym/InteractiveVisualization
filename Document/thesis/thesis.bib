	Abstract = {Parallel coordinates and scatterplot matrices are$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwidely used to visualize multi-dimensional data$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsets. But these visualization techniques are insufficient$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwhen the number of dimensions grows.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nTo solve this problem, different approaches to preselect$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe best views or dimensions have been proposed$\backslash$r$\backslash$nin the last years. However, there are still several$\backslash$r$\backslash$nshortcomings to these methods. In this paper$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwe present three new methods to explore multivariate$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndata sets: a parallel coordinates matrix, in analogy$\backslash$r$\backslash$nto the well-known scatterplot matrix, a classbased$\backslash$r$\backslash$nscatterplot matrix that aims at finding good$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprojections for each class pair, and an importance$\backslash$r$\backslash$naware algorithm to sort the dimensions of scatterplot$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand parallel coordinates matrices.},

@article{FILIS2011152,
	Abstract = {The paper investigates the time-varying correlation between stock market prices and oil prices for oil-importing and oil-exporting countries. A DCC-GARCH-GJR approach is employed to test the above hypothesis based on data from six countries; Oil-exporting: Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Oil-importing: USA, Germany, Netherlands. The contemporaneous correlation results show that i) although time-varying correlation does not differ for oil-importing and oil-exporting economies, ii) the correlation increases positively (negatively) in respond to important aggregate demand-side (precautionary demand) oil price shocks, which are caused due to global business cycle's fluctuations or world turmoil (i.e. wars). Supply-side oil price shocks do not influence the relationship of the two markets. The lagged correlation results show that oil prices exercise a negative effect in all stock markets, regardless the origin of the oil price shock. The only exception is the 2008 global financial crisis where the lagged oil prices exhibit a positive correlation with stock markets. Finally, we conclude that in periods of significant economic turmoil the oil market is not a ``safe haven'' for offering protection against stock market losses.},
